#Blog

## 24/08/27

- A little late to the show with the blog and notes....
- Figured out the layout to have multiple vertical pages of equal height and commented it in the code.
- Set the page back to a single page that swaps the other pages in and out.
- Initial prototype of the two page design
- `displayValue = window.getComputedStyle(element).display;` unless you force set the value first. Otherwise it often reads '' on the first pass.
- Worked on nav buttons, and added WeatherKitty placeholder.
